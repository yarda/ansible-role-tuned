# Tuned profile configuration

# Whether to auto set the Tuned profile which is recommended for the
# machine / product. This variable is considered false if the machine has
# Tuned legacy.

# This is also by default used as a input of 'tuned_profile_legacy'
# (the profile name to be set with Tuned legacy) after
# pre-processing / compatibility mapping (see bellow). If empty string is
# used, no profile will be set (i.e. it will keep the current profile whatever
# it is).

# Tuned legacy has different profile names, this variable maps Tuned profile
# names to the most appropriate / similar Tuned legacy profile names.

# current profile.

# Tuned / Tuned legacy custom profiles deployment

# Whether to deploy custom Tuned profiles from the
# 'deploy_tuned_profiles_srcpath'  directory. Under this directory there are
# 'tuned' and 'tuned_legacy' subdirectories which can hold custom Tuned and
# Tuned legacy profiles. In case of Tuned, there can be also custom Tuned
