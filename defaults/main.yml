# Two non-compatible versions of Tuned exists - Tuned (RHEL-7+) and

# Tuned profile configuration

# Whether to auto set the Tuned profile which is recommended for the
# machine / product. This variable is considered false if the machine has
# Tuned legacy.
tuned_set_recommended_profile: false

# Tuned profile to set if the 'tuned_set_recommended_profile' is 'false'.
# This is also by default used as a input of 'tuned_legacy_profile'
# (the profile name to be set with Tuned legacy) after
# pre-processing / compatibility mapping (see bellow). If empty string is
# used, no profile will be set (i.e. it will keep the current profile whatever
# it is).

# Tuned legacy profile configuration

# Tuned legacy has different profile names, this variable maps Tuned profile
# names to the most appropriate / similar Tuned legacy profile names.
tuned_legacy_profiles_map: {"balanced": "default", "powersave": "server-powersave"}

# Profile to set with Tuned legacy. By default it's 'tuned_profile' mapped
# through the 'tuned_legacy_profiles_map'. Empty string means not to change the
# current profile.

# Tuned / Tuned legacy custom profiles deployment

# Whether to deploy custom Tuned profiles from the
# 'deploy_tuned_profiles_srcpath'  directory. Under this directory there are
# 'tuned' and 'tuned_legacy' subdirectories which can hold custom Tuned and
# Tuned legacy profiles. In case of Tuned, there can be also custom Tuned
# configuration.
deploy_tuned_profiles: false

# Base directory from which custom Tuned / Tuned legacy profiles can be
# deployed.

# Tuned main configuration templating

# Whether to template Tuned main configuration (not supported with
# Tuned legacy)
